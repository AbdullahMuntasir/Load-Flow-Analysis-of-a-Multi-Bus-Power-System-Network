# Load Flow Analysis of a 9-Bus Power System Network

 ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements and compares **Load Flow (Power Flow) Analysis** of a **9-bus power system** using:
- **MATLAB** (Gaussâ€“Seidel Method)
- **PowerWorld Simulator** (Newtonâ€“Raphson Method)

The aim is to determine **bus voltages, voltage angles, line power flows, and system losses**, and to analyze differences in results between the two methods.

ðŸ“– Background
Load Flow Analysis is a critical tool in power system engineering for:
- Determining voltage magnitude and phase angle at each bus
- Calculating active (MW) and reactive (MVAr) power flows
- Evaluating system losses and voltage regulation
- Ensuring stable and efficient grid operation

This project models a **9-bus test system** with:
- 1 Slack Bus
- 2 PV (Generator) Buses
- 6 PQ (Load) Buses
- 10 Transmission Lines
